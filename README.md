I love to solve problems using programming. A front-end web developer with over 4 years of IT experience.  I create, scale, and optimize web applications. To accomplish this, I focus on the customer requirements, conceptualize and synthesize use cases, and adapt to new insights. 

I have an attitude that helps me to be persistent and hard-working and deliver my tasks well on time. My personal and professional experiences have taught me the following about myself:

I can successfully build the front end of web applications using prevalent technologies like Javascript, Typescript, and React JS.
- I put the customer at the center of all the work that I do.
- I excel in learning and working with new tech stacks and execute big ideas within given constraints. 
- A rational thinker who trusts a data-driven decision-making process. 

I can align, and lead, and I am capable of growing world-class product teams.
- I love to win but always focus on ensuring that my team wins is a lot more satisfying.
- I am passionate about tech and love to speak about it. 
- I love to express my opinions on topics related to tech, code, and sports.

I am constantly looking to learn, develop, and nurture new skills. 
- I am constantly learning because I am inquisitive.
- I possess a calm head and can face adversity with a rational mind.
- I focus on making high-quality decisions

I enjoy meeting new people and listening to new perspectives.
